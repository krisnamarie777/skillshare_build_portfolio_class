# skillshare_build_portfolio_class
Repository created using SkillShare Teacher John Morris's Class: Build a Portfolio Website Template from Scratch

The class which this code is based on is available at https://www.skillshare.com/en/classes/build-a-portfolio-website-template-from-scratch-using-html-css-jquery-php/893014576

Please note: in some instances I may tinker and refactor the code John Morris discusses in order to get it to work.   I believe the class may be rather old.
